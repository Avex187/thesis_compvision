# The general flow of this study, represented in the code are:

## 1. Design of building-nonbuilding binary classification CNN model to aid the next data mining process with **Building - Non Building GSV Binary Classification.ipynb**
## 2. Execution of data mining process (for Random Sampled Dataset) using Google Street View API with **Image_Generator_StreetView API.ipynb**
## 3. Dataset compilation, and organizing the train-test-split for each dataset using **Dataset Creation.ipynb**
## 4. Perform augmentation process *only in training set* to enhance generalization capability of CNN model using **Data Augmentation Generator.ipynb**
## 5. Perform Hyperparameter optimization for Adam learning rate and batch size for each dataset, using random search method. **Hyperparameter Optimization.ipynb**
## 6. Perform main task : training, validation, and testing for each models, using **Typology Classifier.ipynb**
## 7. Evaluation of model performance, tested on other domains with **Domain Transfer.ipynb** , and evaluation of model outputs in recognizing building objects and its detailed features differentiating each typology with **GradCAM Visualization.ipynb**
